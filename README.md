Predictive Maintenance for aircraft engine using FD0001 dataset from NASA repository.

The model implementation involves dimension reduction technique UMAP with Deep LSTM model. It consist of the comparative study with the other state of the art approaches and 
the result shows that using UMAP dimension reduction helps in improving the RUL predictive for the aircraft engine.
